## About the project

Our project goal was to design a website that will help users have more Ethical Eating. Our goal was to allow users to be able enter common meals or enter their own ingredients to build a recipe. From there, our website will provide users with potential issues with ingredients and provide more ethical aleternatives that mahy better. Additional features include being able to create and log in, save and review their ethical recipes later. Users who do not want to make an account can also use our site as a guest!
